# Changelog

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-12

First public release.

### Added
- Any number of accounts, defined in `~/.claude-switch/config.json`, tried in priority order.
- `cc add <id>` / `cc remove <id>` — guided setup and removal, with guard rails on the cases
  that can destroy a login.
- Fallback chain: Claude accounts, then an optional pay-per-token API key, then an optional
  external CLI.
- `cc-switch` plugin: names the account in use at session start, and announces a rate limit
  the moment it lands.
- Test suite: 106 assertions across five suites, no framework and no API quota required.

### Notes
- Replaces an earlier two-account script that hardcoded both config directories.
- Existing installs migrate automatically on first run.
